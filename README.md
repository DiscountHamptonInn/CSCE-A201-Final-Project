# CSCE-A201-Final-Project

The purpose of this project is to generate a sudoku puzzle that is guaranteed to only have one valid solution and allow the user to fill out the puzzle. Be sure to include the "getinput.h" header file in the working directory. Once included, the sudoku generator is ran the same way you would 
run any C++ program, using any C++ IDE appropriately. When ran, you can play it by filling in each square according the rules of sudoku, but must follow the format given by the program ("row,col=symbol" where symbol is the number you want to fill in, row is the row of the empty spot you want 
to fill in, and col is the column of the empty spot you want to fill in). While playing, you can contiue filling in all the empty spaces until you correctly finish the sudoku, or you can quit at any time; both options lead to the program finishing.
